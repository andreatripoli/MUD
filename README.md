# What is MUD
MUD, acronym for Malicious URL Detector, arises from the need to analyze the real time if a site we visit is a possible malicious url. MUD warns us of the possible danger in order to avoid phishing attempts, etc... . MUD uses 24 factors and Machine Learning algorithm to analyze and accurately evaluate the degree of danger.

# How to install
Currently, MUD is present as an extension in the *Chrome Web Store* and you can install it for free from it. It will be possible to go to the website [www.google.com](www.google.com) and click on *Add.*

# How Does It Work
The operation of MUD is quite simple. Once the plugin is installed, you will be able to browse your sites safely. Whenever we browse a site, the url will be scanned and evaluated in real time. MUD provides three answers:
1. **Warning**: the url is being scanned and evaluated
2. **Danger**: the url was rated as dangerous
3. **Safe**: the url was rated safe
4. **Disabled**: the plugin has been disabled. Click on the icon to enable it
